  File clarification:
    Compute gradient information of the input grayscale image
    - Input I_gray: H x W matrix as image
    - Output Mag: H x W matrix represents the magnitude of derivatives
    - Output Magx: H x W matrix represents the magnitude of derivatives along x-axis
    - Output Magy: H x W matrix represents the magnitude of derivatives along y-axis
    - Output Ori: H x W matrix represents the orientation of derivatives
